### Introduction

In this exercise, you will practice the use of an algorithm to make a cup of instant coffee. The purpose is to lay out the steps required in order to get the final product.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Start with the inputs - what is needed to make a cup of instant coffee?

- Instant coffee
- Hot water
- A cup
- A spoon
- Optional: milk, sugar, cream

#### Step 2: Think about all the steps required in the physical aspect of making a cup of instant coffee.

1. Boil water using a kettle or microwave.
2. Take a clean cup.
3. Add the desired amount of instant coffee into the cup.
4. Pour the hot water into the cup.
5. Stir the coffee with a spoon until the granules are fully dissolved.
6. (Optional) Add sugar to taste.
7. (Optional) Add milk to taste.
8. (Optional) Add cream to taste.
9. Stir the mixture again to combine the ingredients well.

#### Step 3: Consider the edge cases of optional things like milk or sugar, some people may want it.

- If sugar is desired, add the desired amount of sugar after pouring hot water.
- If milk is desired, add it after stirring in the sugar.

#### Step 4: The algorithm when complete should have as its final result a cup of coffee.

### Algorithm

1. **Input**: Gather all necessary ingredients and tools: instant coffee, hot water, a cup, a spoon, optional milk, and optional sugar.
2. **Boil Water**: Heat the water until it reaches a boiling point.
3. **Prepare Cup**: Take a clean cup.
4. **Add Coffee**: Put the desired amount of instant coffee into the cup.
5. **Pour Water**: Pour the boiled water into the cup.
6. **Stir Coffee**: Use a spoon to stir the coffee until it is fully dissolved.
7. **Add Sugar (Optional)**: If desired, add sugar to taste and stir until dissolved.
8. **Add Milk (Optional)**: If desired, add milk to taste and stir to combine.
9. **Final Stir**: Ensure all ingredients are well mixed.
10. **Output**: A cup of instant coffee ready to be enjoyed.

### Tips

- **Planning is Key**: Make sure to plan each step carefully and consider the order in which you perform them to ensure a smooth process.
- **Consider Preferences**: Not everyone likes their coffee the same way, so be sure to account for optional additions like milk and sugar.
- **Safety**: Be cautious when handling hot water to avoid burns.
